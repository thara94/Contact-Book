# Contact-Book
This is a contact book project for different users.
The code will promopte users to make user and password if the user does not have one. 
If the user have user name, the user can sign in and a graphic interface will pop up and the user choose what to do with the files such as add, delete, edit, or exit contacts.


In this code I had to import tkinter to add a graphic interface.
At the beging the code would ask the user for user and passwor, then the txt file name. If the file does not exist the code will make one.
A pop windo with the contact file will show.
In the window there is a information inpute area.
In the information input area the usr can enter a new contact name, phone, and info and press the Add button to add it to the text file
The user can use the same input area to enter contact name, phone, info and press the delete button to delete a contact, or edit the number by presssing edit button.
The user can use the exit button to exit the contact book.

If I had more time I would work on debugging my code becaue it seams it does not preform all the things I want.
