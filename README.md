# Contact-Book
This is a contact book project for different users, it will have four text files each file has contact list of certain contact such as family, friends, work, resources. 
The code will promopte users to make user and password if the user does not have one, and uniquely name the contact in the files. 
If the new crated user exists the code will generate two random numbers to the user name. If the user have user name, the user can sign in and choose what to do with the files such as add, delete, lookup, or count contacts.
